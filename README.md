# Spyre, Attempt Six

*"When I first came here, this was all swamp. Everyone said I was daft to build
a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show them. It sank
into the swamp. So I built a second one. And that one sank into the swamp. So I
built a third. That burned down, fell over, and then sank into the swamp. But
the fourth one stayed up. And that’s what you’re going to get, Son, the
strongest castle in all of England."
-King of Swamp Castle, The Holy Grail*

*"So every time you stumble never grumble. Next time you'll bumble even less!
For up from the ashes, up from the ashes, grow the roses of success!"
-Chorus of Tortured Inventors, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang*
